# Password Validity
This program runs on command-line C and checks if the user-inputted password is "valid." This program's password criteria requires at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one symbol.

## Purpose
This program checks a password validity and could be implemented into a larger project when a password's validity needs checked.

In order to run the program, users will need to download the [CS50 library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases) and follow these [instructions](https://github.com/m-saylor/libcs50). The code must then be compiled.
